# Project Overview

## Summary

This project is inspired by the [Pixel Hangar Configuraterer](https://kiblams.co.uk/sc_pixel_art/) by [Blamsmith](https://www.patreon.com/Blamsmith).  This is my attempt to make the interface more user friendly and deliver features such as easy image saving and a more intuitive and creative image creation experience.

Full credit for the art and assets goes to Blamsmith, I'm just responsible for the webpage and functionality (go check Blamsmith out, they have fantastic art!).

### Development

I will be tracking features and updates using issues. Core feature issues will be given first priority, quality of life (qol) issues will be addressed afterwards
